# Advent of Code
Here are my solutions for Advent of Code 2020 - 2024. All of these solutions are fully my own. I use these problems as a way to explore and gain a deeper understanding of new languages and programming paradigms. 

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly programming challenge in December where each day a new problem is released. Each problem has two parts that build off of each other. The problems can be solved in any language. The problems typically involve parsing input, navigating 2d/3d grids, working with graphs and graph alogrithms, using dynamic programming techniques, and understanding number theory.

## Solutions
- **2020:** Solved with Java, completed 50/50 parts, `src/twentytwenty`
- **2021:** Solved with Java, completed 34/50 parts, `src/twentytwentyone`
- **2022:** Solved with Rust, completed 43/50 parts, `src/twentytwentytwo`
- **2023:** Solved with Rust, completed 32/50 parts, `src/twentytwentythree`
- **2024:** Solved with Haskell, completed 31/50 parts, `src/twentytwentyfour`

## Utility Libraries
I've written some small utility libraries for each langauge that I've used. These can be found in `src/util`. They include functions and tools to make reading and parsing the input quicker, working with 2d vectors and grids easier, and adding more ways to manipulate iterators.
